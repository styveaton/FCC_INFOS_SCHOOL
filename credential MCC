Dear William Steve

Congratulations and Welcome to Montgomery College!

 

We are so glad you chose MC as the next step on your educational journey. Whether you are here for a degree, certificate, a couple courses, or transfer to another college, we are here for you.

 

There are a few important steps you need to complete before you can register for classes, so let’s get started!

 

FIRST, you should save your college ID and email information below and keep it safe; you need it to access your MC accounts. 

Montgomery College ID Number (M#): M21226049

MyMC ID: watonfac

MC Email: watonfac@montgomerycollege.edu

SECOND, Montgomery College uses an online portal called MyMC. This is where you access your college email, check financial aid, upload forms, and register for classes.

To get to the MyMC portal, go to the Montgomery College homepage and click the blue “Access MyMC” tab in the top right corner of the page. To set up your login for the first time, go to MyMC and click “Claim Your Account.” Enter your MyMC ID and your M# found in the box above. If you need help, here’s a video demonstration of how to claim your MyMC account. If you do not claim your MyMC account within 30 days, you will be locked out. If this happens, please call the IT Service Desk at 240-567-7222 to reactivate your account.

 

THIRD, don’t miss out! Once you log in to MyMC, set up your Montgomery College email account by clicking on the email icon. You need to check this email regularly. All College communications will come to you at this email and not your personal email account. This includes course information, registration, financial aid, counseling, testing and payment updates.

 

What About Paying for College?

You should apply for federal, state and Montgomery College financial aid. If you do not need financial aid, you can skip this step. If you do need financial aid to help pay for college, complete the FAFSA and explore other types of financial aid. You can also visit the websites below for more information about paying for college, including the tuition installment payment plan.

 

FINAL STEPS:

 

·         Check the Raptor Reference guide to  make sure you are on track to complete the enrollment process.

·         Visit the Assessment and Testing Center page to find out how to determine your placement.

·         Complete the New Student Orientation,  and schedule an appointment to meet with a counselor.

·         Log into MyMC to register for classes. Click on “Registration,” then choose the “Register for Classes” icon.

·         After you register, pay for classes or make payment arrangements by the payment deadline.

·         Stay up-to-date with all important dates and deadlines related to registration, paying for college, advising, and more.

 

For more information, visit Raptor Central, or attend a Future Students event to help you complete the enrollment process.

 

 

On behalf of all of us at Montgomery College, welcome to the Raptor family!

 

 

Sincerely,
