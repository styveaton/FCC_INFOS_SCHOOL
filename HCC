 Hello!
  My name is Professor Liz Hadley, and I would like to welcome you to Hagerstown Community College. I am writing because you indicated on the college application that English is not your first language, and I wanted to help you get started with registering for classes at HCC. In order to help you choose the most appropriate courses, the first question to answer is:

Did you graduate from a U.S. high school with at least a 3.0 GPA?

    If YES, please make sure you have submitted your high school transcripts and then stop by the Registration and Student Support office located in the Student Center. For more information, visit https://www.hagerstowncc.edu/advising


    If NO, then you will need to complete the Accuplacer placement tests at the Academic Testing Center. We strongly recommend that you study and prepare for the placement tests ahead of time.
        Study materials are available at https://www.hagerstowncc.edu/placement-study-materials and https://accuplacer.collegeboard.org/accuplacer/pdf/accuplacer-esl-tests-sample-questions.pdf.
        Once you feel ready to take the tests, please schedule an appointment here https://www2.registerblast.com/hcc/Exam/List
        After you have completed the placement tests, you can visit the Registration and Student Support Office located in the Student Center. For more information, visit https://www.hagerstowncc.edu/advising


If you have any questions about these steps, please reply to this email or contact Marti Grahl (mlgrahl@hagerstowncc.edu; 240-500-2304), Director of DEALS. If you have already met with a Student Support Advisor, please disregard this email.

I wish you all the best in your education journey at Hagerstown Community College.
